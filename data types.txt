Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.

Data types are classifications that specify which type of value a variable can hold in a programming language.
There are 2 types of data types
1)Primitive data type
2)Non primitive data type

PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE
They are available by default and store single value
 
-string(sequence of characters enclosed with double quotes ,single quotes, back ticks(``)
-number (stores number data type like int,float,double,byte,short)
-boolean(true/false)
-undefined(any variable declared but not initialized) let a;
-null (empty of obj)

NON PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE
They are user defined and store multiple values
- Functions, arrays, objects
